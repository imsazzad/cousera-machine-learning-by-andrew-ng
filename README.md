# Machine Learning (Coursera by Andrew Ng)


This is one of the solutions to all the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get more clearer idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.

# ........... Wait
to make sure you have tried, I will try to add some random error in my code. Sorry, this is not to irritate you but to enrich the community of machine learning engineers. :)
chill..
